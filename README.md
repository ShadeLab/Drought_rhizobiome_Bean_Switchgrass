# Drought_rhizobiome_Bean_Switchgrass

This repository contains the workflow for analyzing the DNA and cDNA sequences generated from the drought rhizobiome project. Plants (bean and switchgrass) were exposed to increased drought severity over time, as compared to well watered treatments which acted as controls. Both planted and unplanted treatments were included to tease apart direct drought effects versus plant mediated effects.
